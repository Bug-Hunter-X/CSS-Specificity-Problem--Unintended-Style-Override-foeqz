The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common issue with specificity and inheritance.  The intention is to style the `.item` class, but the `.container .item` selector is unintentionally overriding it due to higher specificity:

```css
.item {
  color: blue;
}

.container .item {
  color: red;
}

.container {
  width: 200px;
}
```

When an element with the class `item` is inside an element with the class `container`, it will display the text in red, not blue, which might be unexpected.

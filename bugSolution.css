The solution involves understanding and properly utilizing CSS specificity. One approach is to use the `!important` flag, but this is generally discouraged due to potential maintenance issues. A better approach is to restructure the CSS or use more specific selectors to your advantage:

```css
.item {
  color: blue;
}

.container {
  width: 200px;
}

/* Correct solution using a more specific selector for the container */
.container .item {
  color: red !important; /*Avoid using !important whenever possible */
}
```

By restructuring the CSS or leveraging specificity rules effectively, you can avoid unintended style overrides and maintain consistent and predictable styling.
